I know you expect me to forget
And pretend to be so unaffected

Step over broken glass on floors
Blame it all on the voices next door
Blame it on a bad dream

All the silence is way too loud
Need a time machine to any place but now
Oh, I’ve been light sleeper
I’ve been light sleeper

I know nothings gonna go away
I’d die trying to keep nightmares at bay
Oh, I’ve been light sleeper
I’ve been a light sleeper

Could I step out in a minute for just a breather
The concrete on my chest ain’t gettin’ lighter

Washing it all down the drain
Pour out your small mistakes
Blame it on a bad dream

All the silence is way too loud
Need a time machine to any place but now
Oh, I’ve been light sleeper
I’ve been light sleeper
I know nothings gonna go away
I’d die trying to keep nightmares at bay
Oh, I’ve been light sleeper
I’ve been a light sleeper

[Bridge]
Blame it all
Blame it all on a bad dream
No I can’t fall
Fall asleep
Blame it all on a bad dream

All the silence is way too loud
Need a time machine to any place but now
Oh, I’ve been light sleeper
I’ve been light sleeper

I know nothings gonna go away
I’d die trying to keep nightmares at bay
Oh, I’ve been light sleeper
I’ve been a light sleeper

Back home
And I double take
'Cause to see you wasn't on my list
Small talk
Like how's your mom?
And the weather?
"It's been pretty shit"
But your face is something I had missed

I've got memories I wish to forget
Bury those thoughts in a graveyard
Call them a waste of breath

Didn't wanna miss you, miss you like this
You called all of the shots
And I couldn't resist
How could you stand in the crossfire?
With no exit wounds?
I was kinda hoping you'd be hurt too

Walk home
Spinning in my head
'Cause we never stood on solid ground
But everything that went up came crashing down
Missed calls
Were my first mistake
And I promise I wanted to be around
But everything that goes up comes crashing down

I've got memories I wish to forget
Bury those thoughts in a graveyard
Call them a waste of breath

Didn't wanna miss you, miss you like this
You called all of the shots
And I couldn't resist
How could you stand in the crossfire?
With no exit wounds?
I was kinda hoping you'd be hurt too

Back home
And I double take
'Cause to see you wasn't on my list
And I can't help thinking this is it

Didn't wanna miss you, miss you like this
You called all of the shots
And I couldn't resist
How could you stand in the crossfire?
With no exit wounds?
I was kinda hoping you'd be hurt too
I was kinda hoping you'd be hurt too

I'm finding it hard to reach you
Not sure what you want me to do
Out of all the bad dreams, you win
Hope to get you out of this nightmare, you're in

But if you won't wake up
I can't make it stop

I know I can't be the driver
Through the landmines you got in your head
We've got some distance to cover
And it's not over yet
Over yet
Over yet

You took the bridge out to Brooklyn
'Cause tunnels make you feel like you're sinking
Windows down, know you won't drown
Airing out the smoke before you get back to the house

Cause you're coming home late
And I can't wait up
I can't wait up

I know I can't be the driver
Through the landmines you got in your head
We've got some distance to cover
And it's not over yet
Oh
Out of all the bad dreams, you win
I can't get you out of the nightmare you're in
But whatever comes at you next
Know it's not over yet
Over yet
Over yet

Never loved who you kept as company
Never sure they really loved me too
You're the only one that I've been missing, can't admit why
Even though I'm dying to

And there are some things that I'd take back
I never thought that I would feel this bad
Make a lot out of a little nothing
It's nothing
'Cause

The party's far from over
Can't take this feels like closure
Without you I'm just misery, misery
I know I should be leaving
Oh God, I hate this feeling
Without you I'm just misery
Misery Missing Company

Can you see that it's been killing me?
Can you tell that I've been distant too?
Watch you laughing with them in the kitchen, you're so different
Anytime they're in the room

When your friend, she came after me that night
Over shit, that shouldn't have been a fight
Just know that I said nothing
It's nothing
But

The party's far from over
Can't take this feels like closure
Without you I'm just misery, misery
I know I should be leaving
Oh God, I hate this feeling
Without you I'm just misery
Misery Missing Company

Oh-Oh
Misery
Oh-Oh
Missing Company
Oh-Oh
Misery

The party's far from over
Can't take this feels like closure
Without you I'm just misery, misery

I know I should be leaving
Oh God, I hate this feeling
Without you I'm just misery, misery
Pretend that I feel nothing
But look what I'm becoming
Without you I'm just misery
Misery Missing Company

We met through old friends
Against my best judgement
I gave you a chance

You sold me on all your lies
And I bought into them
But oh
Only just twice

And I tried my best to play it cool
But you knew I'd be the one to lose
And I tried my best to tell the truth
But you knew I'd be the one to lose
(yeah, the one to lose)

And I feel like I'm sleepwalking
So I'll say never, never again
Can't wake me up 'cause I'm not falling
No, I'm not falling
I'm not falling

Convince me to go out dancing
My tears got the best of me, said I
I didn't understand
Could've pretended it was nothing
Now I wish I had a reset button
So naive to think I didn't drag you along

And I tried my best to play it cool
But you knew I'd be the one to lose
And I tried my best to tell the truth
(the one to lose)
But you know I'm always the one to lose
(yeah, the one to lose)

And I feel like I'm sleepwalking
So I'll say never, never again
Can't wake me up 'cause I'm not falling
No, I'm not falling
I'm not falling

And I feel like I'm sleepwalking
So I'll say never, never again
Can't wake me up, cause I'm not falling
I'm not falling
I'm not falling

And I tried my best to play it cool
But you knew I'd be the one to lose
The one to lose
And I tried my best to tell the truth
But you knew I'd be the one to lose
The one to lose
